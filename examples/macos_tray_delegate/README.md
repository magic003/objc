# MacOS Tray

This is another implementation of the [macos_tray](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/master/examples/macos_tray)
example from the vlang repo. It shows how to use `objc` bindings without writing any Objective-C code.

The behavior is the same as the [MacOS Tray](https://github.com/magic003/objc/tree/main/examples/macos_tray) example
in another folder. It uses `NSApplicationDelegate` to demonstrate the usage of `objc.ClassDel`.
